            <h1>Sir Wilfrid Laurier Student Coin (SWL Coin)</h1>
            <p><em>Cryptocurrency</em></p>
            <h2>1 About the Author</h2>
            <p>
                Firstly, I will do my best to keep my identity a secret. Although all my close friends will be able to figure out I am the author of SWL Coin. One thing about myself I will share is that I am a student attending <em>Sir Wilfrid Laurier SS.</em> This is the first website I've ever written so the quality is pretty bad. But could you do better? The same goes for the SWL Coin. This is the first cryptocurrency I’ve ever programmed.<br><br>I came up with the idea of making a cryptocurrency amongst the students over the Christmas break of 2023. It sounded like a pipedream but after putting more thought into it I soon came to realize it was a reasonably possible feat given my skillset. I have no intention of abusing the power I have over the servers. If anyone is skeptical about this, there is a paragraph explaining how anyone can validate this claim under <b>2.4 Transaction & Balance Logs</b>.
            </p>
            <h2>2 The Coin</h2>
            <p><em>Everything about the coin itself.</em></p>
            <h3>2.1 Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Although the SWL Coin is not a <em>true</em> cryptocurrency. It works fairly similarly. With the exceptions of:<li>Not being able to mine coins</li><li>Not being able to generate keys and addresses from private keys</li><li>Crypto wallet being controlled by a singular person</li><br>I call it a cryptocurrency not because it is one, but simply because it just makes it simpler for everyone to understand roughly what it is. Its more close in design to video game currency like V-Bucks and Robux. However, I will continue to refer to it as a cryptocurrency.<br><br> Anyways, to the point. After you register your account, <b>100 SWL Coins</b> will be deposited into your account. With these coins, you can transfer them to other accounts using the <b>address</b> associated with them. More on that later. With these features, I am hoping students can set up an in-school economy where people can trade things like pencils and other materials for coins within the school. The value of the coin is up to you. However, trading these coins for cash is most likely considered tax evasion. Though very mild, I still strongly discourage it and <b>I am not responsible if anyone gets into legal/domestic trouble for their actions regarding the coin</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>2.2 Registering an Account</h2>
            <p>
                Only students of Sir Wilfrid Laurier can register an account. The registration process is simple but can take a while since I have to manually verify each application. Applying goes as follows:<li>Aquire your <b>student ID card</b></li><li>Send an email to <b>swl.student.coin@gmail.com</b> containing a clear picture of your student ID card</li><br>After review, assuming you haven’t registered before, you will receive a reply to your email containing your account address and private key. <b>Do NOT share your private key</b> as it will give anyone access to transfer funds from your account using the key. If this happens I will not be giving you a new account with funds. I also won’t give you a new key. So be careful.
            </p>
            <h3>2.3 Transfering Coins</h3>
            <p>
                Trading the coin itself is a pretty simple process.<li>Go to the <a href="https://swl-student-coin.github.io/transfer">transfer page</a></li><li>Enter your <b>private key</b> and the <b>address</b> of the account you’re trying to transfer your coins into</li><li>Then enter in the number of coins you wish to send. Assuming you have enough in your account</li><li>Once all that is completed, simply click transfer</li><br>If everything checks out on the server then you will see a <em>Transfer Completed</em> message pop up. If something goes wrong you may have typed information incorrectly or there is an issue on the server. In that case, all you can do is wait.
            </p>
            <h3>2.4 Transaction & Balance Logs</h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://swl-student-coin.github.io/logs">logs page</a> is a database where anyone can view all completed transfers and everyone's balance. Your full name will be attached to your account. However, you don't have to worry about privacy because only other students will be able to access the database using their private key.<br><br>Attached to each transaction log contains the following information:<li>The date & time of the transaction</li><li>Amount of SWL Coins that were transfered</li><li>Which two people were involved in the transaction</li><br>Attached to each balance log you can find the following information:<li>The date & time the account was added</li><li>Transactions involving that student</li><li>The balance of that student</li>
